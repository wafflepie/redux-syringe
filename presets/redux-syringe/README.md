Store enhancers and utilities for asynchronous injection of Redux dependencies and development of multi-instance components with isolated state. Redux Syringe supports injection and namespacing of reducers, middleware, and [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) epics.

Although the Redux Syringe core is platform-agnostic, [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) bindings are included for tying the injection mechanism to the lifecycle of your React components.
