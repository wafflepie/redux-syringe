Redux Syringe consists mainly of:

- [Store enhancers](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/docs/Glossary.md#store-enhancer) for injecting reducers, middleware, and epics into your Redux store after the store is created.
- Utility functions for less verbose definitions of action creators and reducers.
- Logic for managing your state via namespaces.
